## 🔧 Styling & Conventions
- Tailwind 4 utilities with arbitrary values (e.g., `font-['font1']`).
- Cards use subtle borders (`border-white/10`), rounded corners, and dark tones.
- Hover underlines in the footer are limited to text width using a child `span` with `::after`.
- Buttons use `cursor-pointer` for consistent affordance.

## 📸 Sections Overview (selected)
- `Tenth.jsx`: Icon top-left, arrow button top-right, title/desc aligned to the bottom.
- `Twelfth.jsx`: Image with center overlay arrow + label pill; title/desc; read-more row.
- `Thirteenth.jsx`: Newsletter with three responsive layouts (lg grid, md compact, sm stacked).
- `Footer.jsx`: Left brand panel, right link grid (row-span), bottom bar aligned under left.
